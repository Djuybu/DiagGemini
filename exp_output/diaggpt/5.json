There's a small coffee shop called 'Bean Brewed' across the street from where it happened. The area is usually quiet, with a few benches and a small playground nearby.

The second one was shorter, about 5'7\", with a heavier build. He had a shaved head and was wearing a red jacket and dark pants. He was the one who took my belongings. \n\nAs for distinctive features, the taller one had a tattoo on his neck, it looked like a snake or some sort of reptile. The shorter one had a scar on his left cheek. Their behavior was aggressive and intimidating. They spoke in a low, threatening tone and were very quick and efficient in their actions, which leads me to believe they might have done this before.", "system": "I'm sorry you had to go through such a distressing experience.

However, I do recall that the coffee shop 'Bean Brewed' across the street has a security camera facing the park. It's possible that their camera might have captured the incident.
