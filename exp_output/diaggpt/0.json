It's not always easy, especially when you're dealing with a heavy workload. Here are some additional strategies you might find helpful:\n\n1. **Stress Management**: \n   - **Mindfulness and Meditation**: These practices can help you stay focused on the present moment and reduce anxiety. There are many apps and online resources available to guide you through these practices.\n   - **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise can help reduce stress and improve your mood. Since you enjoy running and basketball, try to incorporate these activities into your routine as much as possible.\n   - **Healthy Eating**: A balanced diet can also help manage stress levels. Try to include plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains in your diet.\n\n2. **Sleep Improvement**:\n   - **Establish a Routine**: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and improve the quality of your sleep.\n   - **Create a Restful Environment**: Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using earplugs, an eye mask, or a white noise machine if necessary.\n   - **Limit Screen Time Before Bed**: The light emitted by phones, tablets, computers, and TVs can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. Try to turn off these devices at least an hour before bed.\n\nRemember, it's important to listen to your body and give it the rest it needs.
